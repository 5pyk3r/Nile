 ## Application development ideas
   Still a lot to do in project in the near future:
     - search engine with e.g: ElasticSearch on toolbar
     - clients comments and rating(0-5 stars) under product that client ordered
     - pagination
     - gallery with slider of some products on main page with managment on admin 
     - better UI 
     - user panel with more functionality like: setting, change password, address, e-mail, etc.
     - AWS based e-mail sender when: user register, password changing(with some tokenization),  email user when he order products and receive products
     - AWS store full app
     - statistics of sale on admin page(charts)
